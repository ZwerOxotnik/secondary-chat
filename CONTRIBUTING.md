### Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:

- We indent using two spaces (soft tabs)
- Read [a note about Git commit messages](https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)
- Each branch is divided into versions of the game Factorio x.x (e.g., 0.16)

### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

- Ask any question to [ZwerOxotnik](https://gitlab.com/ZwerOxotnik).
